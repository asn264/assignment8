This is my submission for Assignment 8. 

To generate the solutions, run:
	python assignment8.py

The program will request a list of positions per the assignment. 
These must be: surrounded by brackets, separated by commas, and be positive integer values in (1,10,100,1000).

The following is an example of valid list input:
	[1,10,100]

The following are not:
	[1 10 100]
	[1, 10.0, 100]
	1 10 100
	[ one, ten, 100 ]

For number of trials provide a positive integer value. "5" will be accepted but "5.0" will not. 

The program will generate the results files in the current directory. Testing is provided.
